There were a couple rough spots in this assignment but for the most part it went very well. I can definitely see how useful the different terminal flags are, as well as the importance of resetting them when the program exits.

NOTE TO SELF - Copy \033[7m and \033[m rather than typing them in normally so that you don't miss characters and your printf() won't get mad at you.
